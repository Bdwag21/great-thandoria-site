        <summary>Founding and the Great Restoration War</summary>
        <p>The Empire of Great Thandoria was founded in the aftermath of the Great Restoration War (1825–1850), which unified fragmented territories under one banner. Prior to this, the region was divided into feudal states, each governed by rival lords. Economic stagnation, political instability, and border skirmishes crippled the area’s potential.</p>
        
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Early 19th-century Great Thandoria was chaotic, with small feudal states ruled by ambitious lords. Political rivalries caused border skirmishes, economic stagnation, and widespread hardship.</p>

        <h3>Emergence of Emperor Thandor I</h3>
        <p>In 1835, Emperor Thandor I rose from Tasmania, using a combination of diplomacy and military strategy to unify the region:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Diplomatic Alliances:</strong> Negotiated treaties and marriages with smaller states to secure loyalty.</li>
          <li><strong>Strategic Military Campaigns:</strong> Led innovative campaigns against larger rivals, using speed, maneuvering, and militia training to outsmart opponents.</li>
        </ul>
